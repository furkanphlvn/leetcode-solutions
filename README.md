# leetcode-solutions
My solutions to LeetCode problems (in C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)

I usually start solving problems in **C#** as my primary language, but since my goal is learning and improving, I plan to implement the same solutions in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and possibly **Java** in the future. For now, all solutions start with **C#**, and other languages will follow gradually.
